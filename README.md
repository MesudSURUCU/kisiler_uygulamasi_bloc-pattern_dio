Internet-based operations : HTTP-Dio library
State Management : Bloc(Cubit) Patterns

I have designed a phonebook application that uses the Dio library to fetch information from the internet, displays it on the main page, allows adding new contacts to the displayed list, and enables updating the information of existing contacts. Users can also delete saved contacts, and to prevent accidental deletions, the application utilizes a SnackBar to inform the user. To enhance the stability of the application, I employed the Bloc pattern for state management.
